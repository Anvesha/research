it is a new  what to do  is dfno what to if there is so much to consider what we have like if  currently so much perl scripting nest nextsteps nextsteps Since last one year I have developed this habit of not checking any of my gadgets (including laptop and cellphone) as soon as I wake up.I do not check any mails/messages or apps after I wake up (min till 1 hour-max 4 hours â€“ after I wake up)
